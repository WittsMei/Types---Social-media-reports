# Types---Social-media-reports



### Types of reports 
To ensure all stakeholders get the information they need from your report, there are three types of reports any social media marketer should be knowledgeable about. The best way to provide comprehensive data on every aspect of the campaign is to present each type of report to necessary stakeholders. So, how do you know when to use each type of report? Keep reading for more information on operational, insight, and informative reporting.

### Operational reports
Operational reports give team members real-time updates and information on metrics like audience growth rates, impressions, click-through rates, and more. These reports provide social media marketers with the data they need to track a campaign's success—and fast—so they can adjust their strategy when necessary.

### Insight reports
Insight reports offer more than just raw data to your team members and stakeholders—they provide storylines that help explain your campaign. The purpose of insight reporting is to search for meaning in the data and to communicate that meaning at a high-level to stakeholders. These reports answer questions like: why are your click-through rates high? Which social media platforms generate the most leads? Does your audience prefer video-based content or image-based content, and what does that mean for your budget? What trends do you see in the data and why?

### Informative reports
Informative reports are mostly used to provide company leadership with a broader understanding of campaign performance. Larger metrics like return on investment (ROI), and other key performance indicators (KPIs) are presented in informative reports because they show the value of campaigns at a high-level. These reports should be very clear and concise, as company leaders may not have a lot of time to analyze insights.
